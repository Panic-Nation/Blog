Crashing on the couch after work last Tuesday I turned on the TV to catch up on the newest episode of my favorite TV Show: Legion.

When you watch this show, it’s safe to assume you’re in for about an hour of trippy mutant goodness. But the music performance in the first episode of the third season was unexpected and featured a group who have quickly found themselves to the top of my Spotify playlist – Superorganism.

After the show I researched the group and discovered that they are an indie pop band from London, although the members come from all over the world including England, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

I learned that the song featured in Legion was their very first single titled; “Something For Your M.I.N.D.”, a mellow track with monotone, almost speaking vocals over a blend of electronic and acoustic instruments.

I fell in love with this song and had it on repeat all weekend. I decided to go a little deeper into the group’s library and discovered several more jams that I’ve come to adore with my personal favorite being the upbeat and drum-heavy “Night Time”.

Superorganism also produces very psychedelic music videos for their songs that can be quite interesting to watch.

But reading about them won’t give you the same impression as listening to their music yourself so I’ve provided several links below. Check them out to see if the group's unusual style accommodates your tastes!
