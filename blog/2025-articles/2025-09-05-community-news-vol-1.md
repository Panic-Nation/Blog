## Introduction
:::info[Mission Statement]
**Panic Nation** is the title given to the ever evolving family of friends that exists in the online space. 

We specialize in gaming, but our primary focus is to provide a community based on **love**, **support** and **camaraderie**. 

We strive to be a place where everyone has a voice can be assured that they will be heard. 

We do not focus on activity, skill or ranks here. 

Instead we encourage **creativity**, **socialization** and **acceptance**. 

So whether **Panic Nation** is destined to become your permanent home, or you're just passing through, we're happy to be a chapter in your story and wish you the best of luck in wherever life may take you.

*As always,*
*Thanks for playing.*

That message was originally written and shared to the Panic Nation Discord server on April 16th, 2019. 

Despite only being formally posted on a random Tuesday over 6 years ago, the idea that everything we do is better together has been our guiding principle since Panic Nation was founded as a Call of Duty clan in May of 2013. 

By creating a space for people to unwind and truly be themselves among friends and not focusing on silly things like activity or skill, Panic Nation has managed to persist for over a decade. 

It's not hyperbole to state that many of us have legitimately grown up together-with some members who joined during middle and high school now well into their careers and raising families. 

The way we engage and interact has changed and evolved over the years, with daily 10-14 hour Destiny and Grand Theft Auto marathons giving way to once or twice a week party chats that can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours or even just a quick conversation on Discord every few months. 

But even though we've all grown older, had our priorities shift, and find less time to game together, one fact still remains - <u>**Panic Nation is better with friends.**</u>

Our community is diverse with members representing all walks of life and drastically different skill sets. 

The website you're currently viewing was put together slowly over time as a passion project between Bubbafett5611 and myself. 

We both had a desire to create. 

Bubba wanted to build a website. I wanted a place to write. Both of us wanted to do it for dirt cheap and we agreed to do it without time constraints or heavy expectations on the other. 

So just like Panic Nation's guiding principle, we want to build something fun together - without focusing on silly things like minimal contributions, time-sensitive submissions, and so on.

Because we all know... once something fun becomes mandatory, it starts to feel like a job, and once it stops being fun, it's just not worth doing anymore. 

Which brings me to today's topic... 

## Community Contributions! 

We want Panic Nation to be a representation of all of us. 

We want to provide fun ways for our members to create and share their passions with one another. 

So this inaugural issue of our Community News blog post is serving as a call to action to any community members who want to do more. 

Some ideas may include...

## Closing Thoughts

Panic Nation is better with friends. 

Our community is a representation of ourselves and it gets better each time a member leaves their mark. 

This new initiative is an effort to encourage our members to make their mark on the community - no matter how skilled you think you are, if you want to contribute once or a thousand times - you matter and we want you here.
