Welcome to panicnation.net! 

This website has been created as a passion project by Bubbafett5611 and CaptainSlayer to serve as a place to create and share Panic Nation related media and content.

The basic functionality of the website is to serve as a blog where community news, reviews, opinions, and highlights can be shared without the restrictions of other platforms interfering. 

Other features and functionality may be implemented as we move forward!

The goal is to preserve the history of the community and to provide an outlet for expression where we can flex our creativity and try to make cool things for the community to enjoy. 

Bubbafett5611 serves as the primary developer for the website, working to make things function as they should, while CaptainSlayer serves as the primary writer for the website.

For our launch, some legacy content from older websites CaptainSlayer wrote for including Positive Plugs and TylerTried have been ported here, but new content is available as well, including 4 brand new reviews! 
- [Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth Review](https://panicnation.net/blog/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review)
- [Heavy Metal (1981) Review](https://panicnation.net/blog/heavy-metal-1981-review)
- [Children of the Atom Vol 1. Review](https://panicnation.net/blog/children-of-the-atom-vol1-review)
- [Superman (2025) Review (Spoiler Heavy, and my deepest review ever!)](https://panicnation.net/blog/superman-2025-review)

We have also introduced a radio element with both AUTO DJ and Live DJ support! Be sure to check it out over on the [radio page](https://panicnation.net/radio)!

This is our little slice of the internet and we aim to keep it that way. 

We hope you enjoy your time here and thank you for taking a look at what we've built. 

Thanks for playing!
